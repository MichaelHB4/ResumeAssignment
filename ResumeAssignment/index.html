        <h2>Graphic Designer</h2>

        <p>I am studying at Wake Tech earning my associates degree for Advertising and Graphic Design. I have 5 years
          of experience with the Adobe creative cloud apps such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premier, and After
          Effects, and was an Adobe Certified Associate.</p>
        <p>After I earn my associates degree, I plan on continuing school but with a focus on video editing, and multimedia.</p>

          <h3>Birth Sisters Doula Rack Card</h3>
          <img src="placeholder images/Doula_Rackcard.png" alt="Rack card for Birth Sisters Doula">
          <p>For my Client Media Relations class, we were tasked with creating four deliverable products for our client. My groups client was Birth Sisters Doula, and we decided to split up each deliverable. I was tasked with creating the Rack card that would serve to inform potential clients of Birth Sisters Doula. We went through several versions and ultimately ended up with this design. The waves on the bottom of the card ended up resembling pregnant stomachs which the client felt was very appropriate for their business. The waves were then added to some of the other deliverables to create some uniformity.

      <!-- ***********************  WORK EXPERIENCE  *********************** -->
      <section class=work>
        <h2 class=exp>Work Experience</h2>
        <p class=exp> My work experience that relates to graphic design involves customer service. In most of my jobs, I have tasks that need to be done to a customers/clients satisfaction, otherwise it would hurt potential future customers. Another valuable thing I learned is how to work as a team, with graphic design you can almost always expect to work with others on a single project, so being able to work with a team is a key skill.</p>
